      <h3>Interactive Visualizations</h3>
      
      <ol>
          <li> <a href= "http://mvp.columnfivemedia.com/?_ga=2.3369712.1983288366.1511624289-1999001023.1511624289"> First Interactive Visualization: Top 50 Sports Franchises </a> </li>
        <p>The graph shows the most important teams in several sports, measured by Forbes in terms of : number of years of existence (<span class="italic_text">x</span> axis), number of championships won (<span class="italic_text">y</span>  axis), and value in dollars (circle size). </p>
          <p>An advantage of such a representation is that the different colors make it easy to distinguish between different sports.</p>
          <p>The circle size represents the value of the team in dollars. However, it is not an optimal choice; we recall that the human eye tends to underestimate the differences due to area size. According to Stevens' power law, the perception of area size I is proportional to I <sup>0.7</sup>  </p>
          <p>Another advantage is that, if we click on a circle, a small window pops up with the name of the team and detailed information about it. This is an efficient way of compressing a considerable amount of information. </p>
          <p>Then, we have to point out a disadvantage: there is significant overlap between the circles; it becomes difficult to distinguish between several small circles that are nearby (i.e. between teams with similar longevity, success, and monetary value.) </p>
          <p>Moreover, we have no way to assess the total monetary value of a sport, and thus no way to compare it between sports. We can only compare teams, by approximately assessing the area of the circles in the global view.</p>
          
          <br/>
          <li><a href= "https://www.cloudred.com/labprojects/nyctrees/#about"> Second Interactive Visualization: Types of Street Trees in New York City</a> </li>
          <p>This visualization shows the variety and quantity of trees in the streets of all five New York City boroughs.</p>
          <p>An advantage is that we can spot immediately the total number of trees in the various boroughs. We directly compare the row length in the histogram. </p>
          <p>Hovering over a coloured patch highlights the species of the tree in the list. Moreover, it also highlights the corresponding patches in the other boroughs. This way, we have an agile way of referring to the tree species, avoiding having to write overlapping text.
          </p>
          <p>A minor disadvantage is that very small patches are not in scale. Namely, sets containing very few trees (examples: Manhattan, Tulip tree: 13 plants) have approximately the same size as greater sets that are still small compared to the whole (example: Brooklyn, Hackberry, 255 plants.) We do not perceive the small-scale differences properly. <br/>
          On the other hand, this could be considered an advantage: we are able to see and click very small groups that would disappear if represented properly.</p>
          A disadvantage is that it is not easy to compare the number of trees for a particular species across the different boroughs. The optimal choice would have been to provide an alternative view, focusing only on 1 species of tree at the time.

      <h2>Individual part: </h2>
      
      <h4>Andrea Lekkas</h4>
      <p>I would like to be able to build a "news-map" of the world. <br/>
      The data would be extracted from a number of online news sites chosen by the user, called the "source sites". From these, an algorithm would read the title of each news article, and recognize its theme and the country it refers to. <br/>
      The algorithm would place a small flag on the country in question, with its shape and color depending on the theme. There would also be the option to save and archive a flag, so that it remains visible on the map even after its day of appearance.</p>
      <p>The intended recipient is either a citizen that wishes to look up world news, or a journalist that wishes to compare quickly a vast amount of articles that pertain to a particular country or theme over time.<br/>
      In today's world, we are beset by an overwhelming continuous flow of information. The proposed visualization would help a person focus on a particular place or theme, and effectively apply a filter on the global flow of information in order to extract interesting details.</p>

      <h4>Jianfan Chen</h4>
      <p>My goal is to construct a stock market analysis of several pieces of stock from SP 500. </br>
      The source of the stock will from several financial institutes(for example, Dow Jones, Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance) and users can select stocks they want to see the performances over the last 52 weeks and information including beta and some other stock analytical tools will be given as well once the stock is clicked. In the meantime, there is a overall performance for the whole market and it is easier for user to compare how great the extent is that the overall trend of an individual stock is influenced by the overall performance.</p>
      <p>The intended audience of this visualization includes shareholders, finance students and also people working in this field. It is easier for them to grab the information and to compare the stocks by their own wishes.</br>
          Since I am an exchange student who study Finance here primarily, I would like to combine my knowledge in finance with computer science. It would be a good foundational step for my intended career later.</p>
